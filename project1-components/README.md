# Organizing Components into Logical Subcomponents

This project focuses on breaking down larger components into smaller, logically structured subcomponents. It emphasizes understanding component hierarchy, leveraging the children prop to create more maintainable layouts and improve reusability and readability in the UI structure.

## Ideas covered:

- **Component sizes:** Finding the balance between too much abstraction and making a component overly complex
- **Prop drilling:** The process of passing data from a parent component down through multiple levels of nested child components via props, even when intermediate components don't directly use the data
- **Childrens Prop:** Allows a parent component to wrap and render nested child components, enabling dynamic content insertion and layout composition within the parentâ€™s structure.
- **Component Composition:** A React design pattern where components are combined together, often by passing them as children or props, to build complex UIs from smaller, reusable building blocks.

  - Designing Layouts with wrappers

- **Designing Components as API:** Treating props as configurable inputs, similar to function arguments, allowing components to be reused flexibly by defining clear, consistent interfaces for customization and behavior control.
